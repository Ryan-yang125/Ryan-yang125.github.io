*Technical Writing* aims to write *Clear* articles. 

So you have basic strategies to take, just like *10 rules for write a good novel* said.

The first one to make sentences more engaging is using helpful lists: 

- Use terminology—including abbreviations and acronyms—consistently.
- Recognize and disambiguate pesky pronouns.
- Distinguish active voice from passive voice.
- Convert passive voice sentences to active voice.
- Identify three ways in which active voice is superior to passive voice.
- Develop at least three strategies to make sentences clearer and more engaging.
- Develop at least four strategies to shorten sentences.
- Understand the difference between bulleted lists and numbered lists.
- Create helpful lists.
- Create effective lead sentences for paragraphs.
- Focus each paragraph on a single topic.
- State key points at the start of each document.
- Identify your target audience.
- Determine what your target audience already knows and what your target audience needs to learn.
- Understand the curse of knowledge.
- Identify and revise idioms.
- State your document's scope (goals) and audience.
- Break long topics into appropriate sections.
- Use commas, parentheses, colons, em-dashes, and semicolons properly.
